# unbeatable ai_tic_tac_toe bot

### objective 
The purpose of this project is to create an unbeatable tic-tac-toe bot. This is a fairly simple project that uses the minimax algorithm with alpha beta pruning to calculate the best move


### lessons learned 
1. How to break down tic-tac-toe steps into multiple functions and nesting them to create the game & bot 
2. How to understand and apply the minimax algorithm (This same algorithm is used in chess and other decision based games)
